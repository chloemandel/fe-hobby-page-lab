# Buddy Up and Build a Webpage

At Kode with Klossy, we believe that the best way to get good at Web Development is to work with a team of amazing colleagues and support each other from the start. For today's mini-project, you'll be working on refreshing your knowledge of HTML and CSS by building a personal webpage for one of your classmates (and they will build one for you)!

Get to know your partner - Where are they from? What are their interests? What causes do they care about? Try to include links (using the `<a>` tag), images, lists, headers, text, and any other HTML tags that you choose!


## Instructions

+ You don't need to fork and clone this lab.
+ In your command line, `cd` to your main workspace, and create a new folder (using `mkdir`) with the name of your topic. Then `cd` into that directory.
+ Create a new index (home) page called `index.html` and open it up in the text editor.
+ Add in the HTML structure:

```HTML
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

+ Start building out your webpage! We'll come back to it as you learn more, but start adding in `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<ol>` tags, and any others you want to experiment with!
